Game Instructions

The objective of the game is to fill all the blank squares in a game with the correct numbers. There are three very simple constraints to follow. In a 9 by 9 square Sudoku game:

Every row of 9 numbers must include all digits 1 through 9 in any order
Every column of 9 numbers must include all digits 1 through 9 in any order
Every 3 by 3 subsection of  the 9 by 9 square must include all digits 1 through 9

Every Sudoku game begins with a number of squares already filled in, and the difficulty of each game is largely a function of how many squares are filled in. 

  
Guidelines

The user needs to be able to initialize the start state as numerical list ( 0 to 9) separate by a space. The number zero indicates the blank space. See example: 

- 0 0 3 0 0 9 4 6 0
- 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 0 0
- 0 0 0 6 3 2 0 0 0
- 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2
- 0 2 4 0 0 0 6 8 0
- 8 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7
- 0 0 0 5 4 7 0 0 0
- 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0
